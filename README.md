Tasks done during my AI/ML Internship
# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset:-

##  Objective:
To learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

##  Dataset Used:
Iris dataset â€” contains 150 rows of flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and their species.

##  Models Applied:
- No machine learning model applied in Task 1
- This task focuses on data loading, cleaning, and visualization only

##  Key Results and Findings:
- Setosa species is clearly separated from the others
- Petal length and petal width are useful for separating flower types
- Boxplots helped us spot outliers
- Histograms showed distribution trends of each feature
##  Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
